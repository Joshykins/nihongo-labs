# Êó•Êú¨Ë™û-Labs (Nihongo Labs)

A collection of modern web apps for focused Japanese learning practice.

## What is this?

As a developer learning Japanese, I struggled with the fundamentals: number recognition, dates, days of the week. These basics were holding me back from real-world Japanese. Most language learning apps are bloated with features I didn't need - I wanted focused tools I could quickly open in my browser, practice for 5 minutes, and actually see progress.

So I built Nihongo Labs: a collection of modern, lightweight tools that each focus on mastering one essential Japanese skill at a time.

## Learning Tools

### Êï∞Â≠ó-Dash (Suji-Dash)
Master Japanese numbers from 1 to 999 trillion with speed practice and instant feedback.

### Êó•‰ªò-Dash (Hidzuke-Dash)  
Learn Japanese dates, days of the week, months, and time expressions with interactive practice.

## Why Open Source?

I believe in building in public and sharing tools that help others learn. If this helps even one person improve their Japanese fundamentals, it's worth it.
